# distribution tools

Right now the only thing here is the [wiki](https://github.com/tmewett/distribution-tools/wiki).

I want to build a collection of tools and scripts which help distribute software with as few implementation assumptions as possible. Bundlers, self-extractors, auto-updaters... These things already exist but are usually tied to app frameworks; Brogue, as an example, is a plain C and SDL2 game, so we're on our own.

This knowledge is usually figured out by one person by trail-and-error who then sets and forgets the build or CI scripts, only to be looked at by the next unlucky sod when it eventually breaks.
